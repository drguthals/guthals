            description="Building a Mobile App offers basic lessons in Android development, designed specifically for kids! Three fun projects walk you through basic coding skills using MIT's App Inventor―a free, online programming tool that uses a simple block style language that makes coding easy to learn. No long chapters to read, and no homework―just dive right in! You'll begin with a basic project that shows you how to make an app that works; next, you'll put those skills to work on a photo editing app that takes your skills to the next level. Finally, you'll level up one more time to become a Game Maker―that's right, you'll actually build a mobile game that you can send to your friends! Each project includes step-by-step directions and plenty of graphics to help you stay on track, and easy-to-read instructions help you complete each project frustration-free.
                App building can get pretty complicated, but it doesn't have to start out that way. Start small to pick up the basics quickly, and you'll be coding in no time! This book helps you get started quickly and easily, with a focus on fun.
                Build your own Android mobile apps using a free online platform!
                Code everything yourself, including buttons, screens, and interactions!
                Build an app that lets you draw on pictures you take!
                Create a simple, interactive game you can share with your friends!
