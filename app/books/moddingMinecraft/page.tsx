                There’s no doubt about it: Minecraft has taken the world by storm. If your resident Minecraft fanatic is ready to take their experience to a new level of play, introduce them to modding! Modding allows Minecraft players to modify the game through code—giving them the ability to add a variety of gameplay changes, ranging from new blocks and items to new mechanisms to craft. It’s pretty much a Minecraft enthusiast’s dream brought to life! In Modding Minecraft, your child will be introduced to three fun and easy-to-complete projects that teach them the coding skills to make the most of their love of Minecraft.

                Walking young readers through projects that outline how to create games in Minecraft for single or multiple players, this friendly and accessible guide takes the intimidation out of coding and instills confidence in children as young as seven as they complete cool coding projects to mod their favorite game. Full-color, eye-popping graphics and a short page count hold their attention while the goal-based format keeps them focused on the task at hand. Before you know it, your kid will be writing their own mods and having even more fun with Minecraft.

                Kids can complete the projects on their own or alongside an adult
