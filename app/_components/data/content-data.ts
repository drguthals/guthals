Additionally, with K-12 standardized testing moving online, students are being required to improve their computer skills, which, among other factors, has also motivated the discussion to add computer science to the core curriculum [6, 8, 35, 22]. Educational programming languages, such as Scratch [25] and Alice [11], have a set of features that foster their use with younger students [27] such as drag-and-drop, limited API, and visual output.

A common thread among PI courses is that they focus on programs, algorithms, or equations that follow clear rules. In these courses there is usually one answer, though there may be varying approaches to finding it. An open-question in the PI research is: How could PI be incorporated in a course such as Software Engineering, where the focus is risk management and is therefore situational and dependent on personal experience and resources? This paper addresses one approach to developing PI materials for such a course. The pedagogy has been slightly modified: the instructor asks clicker questions, but then asks the students to call out suggestions for the answers. This paper describes this change and presents data from a student survey about their experiences. A call to the community is made to discuss how this and other modifications may be beneficial pedagogical changes to PI.",
